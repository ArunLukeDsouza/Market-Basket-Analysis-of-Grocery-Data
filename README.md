[Market Basket Analysis (MBA)](https://smartbridge.com/market-basket-analysis-101/) is a set of statistical affinity calculations that help managers better understand and ultimately serve their customers by highlighting purchasing patterns. 

In simplest terms, MBA shows what combinations of products most frequently occur together in orders. These relationships can be used to increase profitability through cross-selling, recommendations, promotions, or even the placement of items on a menu or in a store.

The Apriori algorithm is a commonly-applied technique in computational statistics that identifies itemsets that occur with a support greater than a pre-defined value (frequency) and calculates the confidence of all possible rules based on those itemsets.
